					<section id="Foam_Roll_Calves">
						<h2>Foam Roll Calves</h2>
						<p class="reps">30 sec each leg</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4CQRjaq89rk?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Place a foam roller on the ground in front of you while sitting with your legs stretched out in front of you. Place one leg on top of the foam roller so that it is digging into your calf muscle. Place your other leg on top of your leg that is being rolled, and place your hands on the ground. Lift your butt off the  oor using your upper body and roll back and forth on the calf.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="Static_Calf_Stretch">
						<h2>Static Calf Stretch</h2>
						<p class="reps">30-60 sec each side</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_meshtJflR0?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Put a foam roller on the ground, hold onto a wall or something else stable to help you balance, and put your toes up on the roller. Take the leg that you are not stretching and plant it on the  oor in front of the roller. You will feel a deep stretching of the calf. To make this more effective you can activate the calf for 5 seconds by pressing the toes into the roller, and then relaxing the muscles to sink into a deeper stretch.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="Foam_Roll_Front_of_Hips">
						<h2>Foam Roll Front of Hips</h2>
						<p class="reps">30 sec each hip</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uxmeKp_oRZE?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Place a foam roller on the ground in front of you and orient your body on top of the foam roller so that the frontal mus- cles of one hip are on the foam roller. You should be leaning all of your body into the roller when doing this. Stay on the tissues, not the bone, and seek out “knots” or areas that feel tighter than other areas. If you  nd these focus on them with your roller.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="Foam_Roll_Lats">
						<h2>Foam Roll Lats</h2>
						<p class="reps">1x30 seconds on each side</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5BmJJd86vZc?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Start seated and place a foam roller on the ground by your side. Outstretch your arm, lean over, and place your lat on the foam roller (just under the armpit). Roll back and forth on the lat making sure to reorient your body subtly so you can get the lat  bers on your back, not just on your sides. <b>Be VERY careful not to go too low with the roller as you can easily damage your lower ribs. When in doubt staying too high is preferable.</b></p>
					</section>

					<section id="Floor_Based_Lat_Stretching">
						<h2>Floor Based Lat Stretching</h2>
						<p class="reps">1x1 minute on each side</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gn_AC0PODkI?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Start on all fours in a curled position (similar to child’s pose from yoga). Take an arm and reach overhead and across the body with it and then plant the palm  rmly on the  oor. Keeping your body low to the ground, let your hips shift away from the planted palm in order to feel a stretch in the lats. Play around with different angles to produce the maximal amount of stretch on this muscle.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="Foam_Roll_Upper_Back">
						<h2>Foam Roll Upper Back</h2>
						<p class="reps">Sets 1x30 seconds</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J1XoFQCV0aA?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Start seated with a foam roller on the ground behind you. Cross your arms over your chest leaving your feet planted on the  oor and lean back so that the roller is on your upper back. Lift your butt of the ground, keep the core very tight, and roll up and down the upper back.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="Ball_Release_of_Pectorals">
						<h2>Ball Release of Pectorals</h2>
						<p class="reps">1x30 seconds each side</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OMNoSAyBhns?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Place your super nova (or other type of ball) on the ground. Put one pectoral directly onto the ball and place that arm behind the low back. With the arm behind the low back orient your body so that much of your body weight is on the ball. Roll around in this area and look for tight spots. If you are a woman you can still do this as your pectorals are above your breast tissue.</p>
					</section>

					<section id="Pectoral_Stretching">
						<h2>Pectoral Stretching</h2>
						<p class="reps">1x1 minute each side</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y5NE5CTEnvM?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Place your arm up on a doorway, wall, or machine about a vertical foot over the height of your shoulder. Keep the arm bone plugged backwards at the back end of the shoulder socket as you lean forward and allow your pec muscle to open up. Squeeze the shoulder blade of the shoulder that you are stretching towards the other shoulder blade and play around with the angles of this stretch until you can feel it deep in the pecs. If you are feeling this in the front of the shoulder instead of the pectorals then you are probably allowing your arm bone to drift forward, so make sure to keep it plugged back into the end of the socket</p>

						<h2>Mobility</h2>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Multidirectional Ankle Mobilization</h2>
						<p class="reps">1x15 reps each direction (inwards, straight forward, and outwards)</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5jWkgRkfwQ0?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Place your toes facing toward a wall with about a  st’s width between your toes and the wall. Ensure that the ankle stays planted  rmly on the  oor as your drive your knee forward toward the wall. The goal here is to repeatedly touch the wall with the knee, without letting the heel lift off the ground. You are going to perform 45 reps in total. 15 reps will be at an inward angle, 15 will be straightforward, and 15 will be off to the side.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Contract and Relax Anterior Hip Mobilization</h2>
						<p class="reps">2x15 each hip</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i0JmmgcrpT8?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Start in a kneeling position with one knee directly under your hip and the foot of the other leg planted on the  oor in front of you. You want a 90 degree bend in both ankles. Squeeze your core and tilt your pelvis backwards as you rock/shift your hips forward squeezing the glute on the knee that is down, as hard as you can. You will shift forward and then come back and then shift forward a little bit deeper. This is done several times in sequence.</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Thoracic Spine Mobilization</h2>
						<p class="reps">1x50 reps moving up and down the thoracic spine</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HW6SudN6W4Q?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mpUjDoWdA4A?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Start laying on the  oor with a foam roller placed at the same level as the top of your shoulder blades (just below the neck). Slightly tuck the pelvis, keep the knees bent with feet planted on the  oor. Gently allow your body to bend over the foam roller and then crunch back up to a neutral position. After a couple of reps (5-10) you will move the foam roller down an inch or two. You will gradually work your way down to the lower thoracic spine where you will stop. Don’t do this on the lower back!</p>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Shoulder Distraction</h2>
						<p class="reps">1 x 1 min each shoulder</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mAW_HI1fHus?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Wrap a heavy duty resistance band around a stable, supporting structure. Wrap one end right around the head the the arm bone. Try to avoid the collar bone here, we are shooting straight for the top of the arm bone. Place the arm that the band is wrapped around behind the back and lean forward hard allowing the band to pull your shoulder back. When you get here just relax and prepare to hold the stretch for a minute.</p>

	    					<p class="instructions">Start seated on a stable gym bench with your hands gripped around one dumbbell that is resting vertically on your lap. Keep both hands on the dumbbell handle as you lean back and lay on your back. As you lay back transition the dumbbell with you so that it is over your chest and carefully hand it off so that its only in one of your hands. Press your feet into the  oor hard, keep your core and butt tight, and lower the dumbbell down towards the outside of your chest and then exhale hard and press it back up to the starting position focus on squeezing the pectoral and front deltoid muscle (chest and shoulder).</p>

						<h2>Single Arm Cable Overhead Press</h2>
						<p class="reps">6x10 reps each side w/ 45 sec – 1 min in between sets</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4FEEC2r-Z20?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Place a single handle attachment on a cable machine and place the cable pulley all the way down the ma- chine, as low as it goes. Stand adjacent to the pulley in an athletic stance (knees slightly bent, core tight, butt tight, chest lifted). Make sure that the pulley is directly underneath the shoulder that you are going to be training. Keep the core very tight, neck straight, and exhale to press the handle straight overhead. Once you complete one side you will immediately go into the next side. The set is over once the movement has been performed on both arms.</p>

						<h2>Seated Dumbbell Lateral Raises in Scapular Plane</h2>
						<p class="reps">6x10 reps w/ 45 sec – 1 min in between sets</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XQbbcU2n29k?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Start seated upright with a bench that has back support. Start by holding the handle of two dumbbells that are resting on top of your knees. Keep the core braced, shoulders rolled back, and head on top of the spine (it’s easy to push it forward which we are NOT doing here). Raise the arms out away from the body at a 45 degree angle, lower them back down to the hips, and repeat. Go light here are  rst. Although we are working in the scapular plane of motion (45 degrees away from the body) which tends to be easier on the shoulders, still go light. There will be plenty of time to build up enormous strength in this area as we progress through the program.</p>

						<h2>Isometric Push Up Hold</h2>
						<p class="reps">5x30 seconds during the set w/ 30 seconds rest in between sets</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YfhqQMFiL-k?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Assume a normal pushup position (hands directly under the shoulders with legs straight). Hold this position with a neutral spine while squeezing your whole body very tight. The most important part with this is the neutral spine. Keep the back very straight. Don’t let the hips sag or do anything weird or asymmetrical. Additionally, don’t let your head hang down towards the  oor. This is an opportunity to improve forward head posture, so while you are doing this make sure to tuck your chin and push your neck back so that your neck spine (cervical) is very straight.</p>

						<h2>High Rep Face Pulls</h2>
						<p class="reps">2x50 reps w/ 1 min of rest in between sets</p>
						<iframe width="400" height="225" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tiPx4G55_mM?rel=0&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
						<p class="instructions">Wrap your resistance band or voodoo band around a column, machine, or something else that’s very stable and about the same height as your eye line. Back away from the supporting structure, take an athletic stance, exhale and pull the band toward the sides of your face. Focus on squeezing the shoulder blades together when doing this. We are going re- ally high rep here so prepare for a serious burn and pump in shoulder shoulders. Grind through it though and push yourself!</p>

						<p class="instructions">Place a single handle attachment onto a cable machine and set the pulley so that it’s about a foot taller than your head. Stand adjacent to the pulley so that it’s exactly off to the side. Take an athletic stance that’s slightly wider than normal and grab the handle attachment with the hand closest to the cable handle and place your other hand on top of the hand that  rst grabbed the handle (this step is important for optimal muscle recruitment). Keep the chest lifted high as you can and use your oblique muscles to pull the cable across your body toward the opposing hip while keeping the arms locked out and straight.</p>

  					<p class="instructions">Extend your legs back so they are in push up position. Instead of placing your hands on the  oor as though were were going to perform a push up, place the elbows on the ground and lift your body up. Only your forearms and toes should contact the ground. Squeeze the core muscles very hard as you  nish your workout with this exercise. Make sure your spine is straight when performing this. Having a mirror beside you can help tremendously, otherwise you can have someone record you while you perform it to make sure your spine is neutral.</p>

  					<p class="instructions">Stand in an athletic stance with your feet shoulder width apart, slight bend in your knees, and chest lifted high. Place a stick, painting rod, dowel rod, or broomstick on your back. Ensure that the stick is in contact with the back of the head, the upper back, and the back of the pelvis at all times. From here, bend forward by hinging at the hips (like a door hinge) and then return back to standing. Make sure the stick stays in contact with the three areas discussed previ- ously. In essence, this awesome movement pattern reprogramming exercise that will teach your body how to move cor- rectly, keep a neutral spine, and protect your back! You can do this before you even hit the gym. If you do though, make sure you do your dynamic warm up once you arrive at the gym.</p>

  					<p class="instructions">Hold a dumbbell in one hand and start in an athletic stance (you should know what that is by now). Gently lift the leg that’s on the sames side of the arm in which you are holding the dumbbell. At this point you should be standing
            on one leg, make sure that leg has a slight bend in it as you hinge from the hips and lower your body towards the ground. Once your hip angle is at approximately 90 degrees then return back to standing by squeezing the glutes on the leg you are balancing on.
            <br/>For this exercise it’s VERY important that you keep your knee on the standing leg bent slightly until the very top of the movement. Secondly, it’s crucially important that you keep your hips squared and facing towards the  oor with this exercise. Do not allow your hips to open and point off to the side. Keeping the hip oriented towards the ground will help you achieve more muscular balance and optimal muscle recruitment patterns.</p>

  					<p class="instructions">Hold a dumbbell in each hand and place one foot on top of a bench or box. Make sure that the other foot is planted  rmly on the ground and is far enough away from the bench so that when you bend it to 90 degrees the knee re- mains over the ankle. To perform the movement, all you are doing is bending both knees by lowering yourself towards the ground until your knees reach approximately 90 degrees and then you will return back to the starting position.
            <br />It’s very easy to push the leg that’s resting on the bench into the bench to assisst with this movement. This is cheating though so try to avoid that. Keep the leg on the bench as relaxed as possible, and force the leg that’s on the ground to do all the work.</p>

  					<p class="instructions">Start with your back on a stability ball. The ball should be in between your hips and shoulder blades on your back. Lace your  ngers behind your neck to support it, but make sure you are not pulling on your neck. Allow your abdominals to relax which will allow your spine to bend and extend over the ball. Once at the bottom of the movement, squeeze the abs and pull yourself up just a little bit beyond straight before returning back to the start of the movement.<br/>This is a great exercise for the abs. Make sure when you are doing this that the room is clear of sharp or hard de- bris in case you roll over it with the ball or fall off.</p>

Come off to the side of the machine, wrap your  ngers around the handle attachment, and take an athletic stance. Exhale hard as you push your arms in front of you in a straight line and then return them back towards the chest. Do not allow the cable to pull you out of position. Your job here is to  ght the rotation and keep everything pointed straight forward.<br/>This is a great anti-rotation movement for the core. It teaches your body to resist rotational forces that act on the lumbar spine which really helps to stabilize this area and prevent injury.</p>
